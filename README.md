# Parallel Computing: A Hands-On Introduction in MATLAB and Simulink

This hands-on workshop will introduce you to parallel computing with MATLAB® and Simulink®, so that you can solve computationally and data-intensive problems using multicore processors, GPUs, and computer clusters. By working through common scenarios to parallelize MATLAB algorithms and run multiple Simulink simulations in parallel, you will gain an understanding of parallel computing with MATLAB and Simulink and learn about best practices.

The files in this branch are made to work with MATLAB R2025a.

Required toolboxes: 
* MATLAB
* Simulink
* Parallel Computing Toolbox
